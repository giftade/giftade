I’m working towards becoming a builder in blockchain, decentralization, and open source. Right now, I’m focused on learning, experimenting, and improving my skills.

## 🌐 What I care about

- Open-source projects that push decentralization forward.
- Real-world blockchain protocols, smart contracts, and distributed systems.
- Making technology more transparent, secure, and accessible.

## 🛠️ My approach

- Build small things, break them, and figure out how they work.
- Study real projects and contribute when I’m ready.
- Build........
